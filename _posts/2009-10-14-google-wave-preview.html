<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-285  alignright" title="Google Wave Preview Invitation" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gwavepreview-300x72.PNG" alt="Google Wave Preview Invitation" width="300" height="72" />Got my Google Wave invite through this morning, guess I need to RTFM and figure out exactly what it is/does as it all seems a little empty at the moment. Probably not helped by the fact that I don't have any contacts using it either! Hmmm a one-man collaboration tool? About a useful as a chocolate teapot methinks! Got 6 invites left if anyone wants one?</p>
