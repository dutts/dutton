<p>I was so excited to receive the email inviting me to sign up for Google Voice this afternoon I didn't read any further than the sign up link, but after logging in was presented with this:<br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-229 aligncenter" title="Google Voice... Denied" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Picture-2-300x131.png" alt="Google Voice... Denied" width="300" height="131" />Bah! For those who don't know what Google Voice is and can't figure out why I was so excited, check out the full feature list <a title="here" href="http://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html" target="_blank">here</a>; single phone number for your texts, mobile and landline calls, answer and make calls from anywhere, voicemail transcription to your google account to list but a few, so hurry up Google!!!</p>
