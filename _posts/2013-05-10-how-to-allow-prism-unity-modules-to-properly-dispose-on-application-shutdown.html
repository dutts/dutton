<p>I have a Prism application which uses a Unity DI container to load a bunch of modules which represent various elements of my application.</p>
<p>I recently needed to perform some clean-up in one of my modules when the application exits. Normally this is something I would do with an IDisposable implementation, but in a Prism/Unity setup Dispose never gets hit on the module code.</p>
<p>Here's how I got around it:</p>
<p>First I created a custom Event to allow me to signal my modules that the container is closing:</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">public class ApplicationExitEvent : CompositePresentationEvent&lt;string&gt; { }</pre>
<p>Then in my bootstrapper I implement IDisposable and fire the event in my Dispose() method:</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">public void Dispose()
{
  var eventAggregator = Container.Resolve&lt;IEventAggregator&gt;();
  if (eventAggregator != null)
  {
    eventAggregator.GetEvent&lt;ApplicationExitEvent&gt;().Publish("");
  }
}</pre>
<p>Then in my module's Initialize() method I subscribe to this event:</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">EventAggregator.GetEvent&lt;ApplicationExitEvent&gt;().Subscribe((o) =&gt; Dispose(), true);</pre>
<p>And put whatever cleanup code I need in my module's Dispose method. Done!</p>
