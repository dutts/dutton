<p>I've not considered it before as up to now I haven't required it, but obviously in a WPF Application you don't have a nice</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">static void Main(string[] args)
{
...
}</pre>
<p>with a useful string array of arguments like you do in a regular C# console app, so how do you access them?</p>
<p>In a default WPF application, the entry point to the program is <!--more-->the <strong>Application</strong> object. This object has an event <strong>Startup</strong> which is fired, unsurprisingly on startup of your app and contains <strong>StartupEventArgs</strong>. You can query this object to get to your arguments as follows:</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
public partial class App : Application
 {
   /// 
   /// A static string array containing our start-up command line arguments
   /// 
   public static string[] Args;

   protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
   {
       Args = e.Args;
       base.OnStartup(e);
   }
}</pre>
<p>Store them in a static member and then you can access them elsewhere in your application as <strong>Apps.Args</strong>.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But what happens if you actually need some arguments to run, and so want to check and fail gracefully if they don't exist? I found that if I checked in my <strong>OnStartup</strong> handler, I still couldn't halt the start-up of my application on error.</p>
<p>Instead, I added a <strong>Loaded</strong> event handler to my MainWindow. This is fired once the Application and MainWindow have been loaded so I know I my static Args member will have been set by the time it is fired. I can do all the validation I want on my argument array and decide whether to continue execution or stop and provide an error to the user.</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
public MainWindow()
{
     InitializeComponent();

     // Make sure the command line arguments have been processed
     this.Loaded += new RoutedEventHandler(MainWindow_Loaded);
}

void MainWindow_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (App.Args.Length == 1)
    {
        // everything is good, do stuff
    }
    else
    {
        // ERROR!!!
        MessageBox.Show("Not enough arguments!");
        App.Current.Shutdown();
     }
}</pre>
