<p>I know glaciers have been observed moving faster than the current re-development of <a href="http://www.doshtracker.co.uk" target="_blank">DoshTracker</a> but this is the first blog post of many in this new DoshTracker category.</p>
<p>If you've arrived here straight from www.doshtracker.co.uk then welcome to my blog, please feel free to have a look around and find out more about me, who I am and what I do. If you are already a reader of dutton.me.uk then I'll be using postings in this category to provide progress updates on the re-development of DoshTracker, a UK currency tracking site I developed back in 2001 which ran for five years (check out its Wikipedia entry for more info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoshTracker" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>I plan to utilise both the Google Maps API and Ext JS framework in the re-design so I will be posting lots of my findings on getting these two playing nicely. I'm still 100% committed to getting DoshTracker back up and running and from all of the positive feedback I've had from the old user-base you guys want it too, so watch this space.</p>
