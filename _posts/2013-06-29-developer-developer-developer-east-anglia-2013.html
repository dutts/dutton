<p>I've just got back from <a href="http://www.dddeastanglia.com/">DDD East Anglia</a>. This was my first software conference. Although I've been in the industry for over 10 years now I've never managed to get to one, but DDD's policy of holding them at weekend is brilliant (even if it is the same weekend as the British GP ;)).l</p>
<p>An innocent query (from my Red Bull work email) to the organisers about the wifi situation at the venue led to an invite to give a lunchtime "grok" talk on Software Development at Red Bull Technology, so it was a bit of a baptism of fire today (that room looks a hell of a lot bigger from the front, a lot of faces looking back).</p>
<p>Anyway I really enjoyed it, if you've not been to a DDD event I thoroughly recommend it, a lot of very interesting talks from some very knowledgable people (and in today's case some flustered chap babbling about F1). This will definitely not be my last.</p>
