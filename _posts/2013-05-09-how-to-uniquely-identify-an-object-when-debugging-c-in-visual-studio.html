<p>Many years ago I used to develop applications in C++ under Visual Studio and despite thoroughly loving the move to managed code, in particular C# .Net I do find that I occasionally miss some of the ways I used to be able to debug old non-managed programming languages.</p>
<p>One thing in particular I miss when trying to fix a frustratingly elusive bug (normally involving threads or some other equally non-determinstic nightmare ;) ) is the ability to see the memory address of a particular object instance on the heap under the debugger and compare that to an instance where it appears elsewhere in my execution to be <strong>sure</strong> that they are the same.</p>
<p>Up to now I have just written that off as one of those managed code limitations and worked around it. That was until a colleague (cheers Dan) pointed out something that's been under my nose this whole time, this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2022 aligncenter" alt="Make Object ID" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-11-at-22.01.53.png" width="372" height="268" /></p>
<p>In the Locals or Watch windows when debugging, you can right-click on any reference type and "Make Object ID" which will append a number (followed by a '#' surrounded by curly braces) to the end of the value like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-2032 aligncenter" alt="Object ID" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-11-at-22.02.17.png" width="332" height="96" /></p>
<p>This will uniquely identify the object until you either right-click again and select "Delete Object ID" or stop debugging.</p>
<p>And here's its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/Vstudio/ms164903.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN description (under Managed Object Identity)</a>.</p>
<p>I swear I really should RTFM when it comes to Visual Studio. I hoped that this was something new in VS2012 but I fired up an old VS2010 project and there it is again! It's been under my nose this whole time!</p>
