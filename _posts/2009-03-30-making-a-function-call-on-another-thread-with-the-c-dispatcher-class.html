<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a function on a different thread, such as ensuring that calls across the interface between a multi-threaded dll and its single-threaded user are made on the same, single thread.  To achive this, you can use the target thread's Dispatcher object as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a delegate of the function you wish to be able to call:
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
public delegate void MyDelegate(int i, string str);
public class TargetThreadClass 
{ 
    public TargetThreadClass() 
    { 
        MyDelegate del = new MyDelegate(this.FuncToExec); 
    }  
    public void FuncToExec(int i, string str) 
    { 
       // Do something 
   } 
}</pre>
</li>
<li>Within the target thread, create an instance of a Dispatcher object and set it to the thread's current dispatcher:
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
Dispatcher UserDispatcher = Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher;</pre>
<p>Then pass this dispatcher, along with the delegate into the source thread.</li>
<li>Then to call FuncToExec on the target thread, use:
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
UserDispatcher.Invoke(del, new object[] { 123, "arg string"});</pre>
<p>Where the first parameter of Invoke is the delegate itself and the second an array of the delegate's parameters (if any), in this example the delegate takes an int and a string.</li>
</ol>
