<p>I use an iMac at home, so any Windows development is done in a Windows 8 virtual machine running under VMWare Fusion 4.1.4.</p>
<p>I ran into a problem this evening when playing around with some Windows Phone 8 development and thought I'd share the solution. It turns out the default Fusion configuration doesn't support the hardware assisted visualization (Hyper-V) that the Windows Phone SDK Phone Simulator uses.</p>
<p>Not to worry, just do the following (works for me under 4.1.4).<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown the virtual machine.</li>
<li>From the Virtual Machine Library Ctrl-Click on the virtual machine's icon and select <strong>Show in finder</strong>.</li>
<li>Ctrl-click on the vm's bundle under Finder and click <strong>Show Package Contents</strong>.</li>
<li>In there you will find a .vmx file, this is the virtual machine's configuration file. Open this in your favorite editor.</li>
<li>Add the following two lines to the end of the file:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><code>vhv.enable = "TRUE"<br />
hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = "FALSE"</code></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Save the file, restart your VM and the Phone Simulator will work fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: My VM has two processors, I haven't tried this on a single process VM yet.</p>
