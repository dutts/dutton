<p>As a WPF developer, I'm finding the jump to Windows Phone 8 development not as seamless as I had first hoped, here are some of the small differences that have bitten me so far (certainly more to come, I'll be adding to this list and have a few blog posts on the way with some more detail)</p>
<p><strong>TextBlock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Phone OS doesn't support setting a unit qualifier on the FontSize property and will throw an Exception at run-time if you try (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.textblock.fontsize%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank">WPF</a> vs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/system.windows.controls.textblock.fontsize%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" target="_blank">Phone</a>).</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p><strong>MultiBindingConverter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Phone doesn't support IMultiBindingConverter, I'll be blogging about a workaround soon.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p><strong>Style Triggers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are no style triggers in Windows Phone OS, I wanted to change the appearance of a ListBoxItem based on its IsSelected property and had to resort to using VisualStates instead, more to follow.</li>
</ul>
