<p>I've been struggling trying to debug my JavaScript in ASP.Net Web Applications under Visual Studio 2013, it lets me place a breakpoint in the script:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4992 aligncenter" alt="Placing a breakpoint" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/placebreakpoint.png" width="324" height="93" /></p>
<p>But then I hit F5 to run my application under the debugger and it gives me "The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No executable code of the debugger's target code type is associated with this line":</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5002 aligncenter" alt="Breakpoint error" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/breakpointerror.png" width="892" height="127" /></p>
<p>Which is a bit rubbish. I'm sure they have their reasons for letting me place a breakpoint and then so cruelly toying with my emotions in this way but still, it doesn't help me single-step through the nail-biting outcome of my (a &lt; b) conditional, which is frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>Although not ideal (as it involves making code changes to your code), you <em>can</em> cause Visual Studio to break during execution by adding the keyword</p>
<blockquote><p>debugger;</p></blockquote>
<p>to your code like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5012 aligncenter" alt="Adding the debugger keyword" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/debuggerkeyword.png" width="307" height="92" /></p>
<p>Fire up the debugger again and you'll find it break at the line.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-5022 aligncenter" alt="Visual Studio breaking at the debugger line" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/debuggerkeywordbreakpoint.png" width="320" height="92" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It seems to strip out any syntax highlighting while its in this state but at least you can hover over fields to see their value and use the Immediate Window and all the usual Debugger trickery pokery without having to resolve to something like <em>Firebug</em> or <em>IE's F12 Developer Tools.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A big shout out to my good friend Jarek for showing me this. Check out his awesome productivity extension for Visual Studio, <a href="http://vscommands.squaredinfinity.com/" target="_blank">VSCommands</a>.</p>
