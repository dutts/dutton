<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-290 alignright" title="Add-ons may be causing problems" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/firefoxaddons-300x216.PNG" alt="Add-ons may be causing problems" width="300" height="216" />After <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/05/microsoft_update_quietly_insta.html" target="_blank">silently installing</a> their own add-ons to Firefox earlier this year as part of a Microsoft Service Pack, it appears that last last week Mozilla finally got around to blocking them on security grounds.</p>
<p>While Microsoft are happy modifying and 'updating' other people's software in one of their updates, they then seem a bit lapse in keeping on top of the ol' bug fixeroo, one of the primary reasons people flee from IE in the first place.</p>
<p>Prior to Mozilla blocking them, it turns out that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-054.mspx" target="_blank">this</a> particularly nasty 'Critical Remote Code Execution' vulnerability applied not only to IE, but to Firefox installs containing these add-ons. So thanks guys, I'm glad someone's watching our backs! =)</p>
<p>(Now, who knows what this will do to my WPF XBAP testing? After all that I might have to dust down IE!)</p>
