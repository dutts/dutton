A year and a day after my last post, here I am again. I've finally got around to moving from WordPress on Azure, which despite being total overkill for my use, is hideously slow on their ClearDB MySQL instance to the point of being unusable to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages. 

If you can see this you're on the new site and everything has worked. Comments are being migrated to Disqus as I type and will be appearing shortly. I have some broken formatting (code syntax highlighting in particular) to fix but apart from that it was all quite painless.

I used a mixture of the tutorials google served up as none seemed to match my setup exactly, when I get a second I'll write it up.
