<p>It <strong>has</strong> been a while, but not completely quiet on the DoshTracker front. Although last year my Project 365 took up most of my free time, I have been slowly working on another UI design using a new Javascript framework (jQuery) and this time it's really coming together.</p>
<p>We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Google Maps interaction, plotting all our note hits on a map.</li>
<li>International support, now you can plot your notes anywhere the Google Maps API can geocode.</li>
<li>The complete old database! All of your original DoshTracker notes and user accounts have been preserved. These will be imported during the beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the new logo and design on <a href="http://www.doshtracker.co.uk" target="_blank">www.doshtracker.co.uk</a> and please sign up for our mailing list so we can keep in touch.</p>
<p>Invites to the closed beta test will be going out soon to the mailing list and former users of the old site.</p>
