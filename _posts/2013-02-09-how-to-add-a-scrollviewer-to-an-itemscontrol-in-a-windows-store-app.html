<p>I've been working on my first Windows 8 Store App this evening and coming from a WPF rather than Silverlight background have already found a few little differences in the XAML GUI implementation.</p>
<p>Simply wrapping an ItemsControl in a ScrollViewer to provide scrolling functionality for your content as I would in WPF results in some not very nice behaviour in a Windows Store App ItemsControl.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to provide a ScrollViewer as part of your ItemsControl.Template as follows.</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
<itemscontrol>
<itemscontrol.template>
<controltemplate>
<scrollviewer padding="{TemplateBinding Padding}">
<itemspresenter />
</scrollviewer>
</controltemplate>
</itemscontrol.template>
</itemscontrol>
</pre>
