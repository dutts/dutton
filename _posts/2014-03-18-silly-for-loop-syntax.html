<p>I've been working with C-style languages for over 12 years now, but stumbled across this funny for loop syntax in a code tutorial today and had to double-take:</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
for (int i = 2; i --> 0;)
{
    // do something
}
</pre>
<p>Although technically correct, quite what you gain from putting the <em>iterator </em> within the <em>condition</em> apart from confusion is lost on me.</p>
