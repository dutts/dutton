<p>I came across a scenario today where I needed to hook into dependency property changes on an object that wasn't mine and found this new trick I'd not seen before, you can get the property's descriptor and add a new value changed handler in code.</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">var descriptor = DependencyPropertyDescriptor.FromProperty(RadioButton.IsCheckedProperty, typeof(RadioButton));
descriptor.AddValueChanged(radioButton, (s,e) =&gt; { /* ... */ });</pre>
<p>Don't forget to remove the handler again once you're finished with it to prevent memory leaks like so.</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">descriptor.RemoveValueChanged(...);</pre>
