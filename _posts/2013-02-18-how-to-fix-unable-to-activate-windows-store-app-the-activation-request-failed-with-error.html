<p>Those of you who know me will know that I'm a bit of an Apple fan-boy, so anything running Windows natively has over the years experienced a rather unceremonious departure from my tech collection.</p>
<p>That does make my current pet project of playing around with Windows 8 App Store development slightly tricky, so I've turned to virtualising Windows 8 under VMWare Fusion to get my out of work C# fix. This generally works well, except I seem to regularly run into this error when I first run my app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Unable-to-activate-Windows-Store-app-Issue-with-its-license.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-479" alt="Unable-to-activate-Windows-Store-app-Issue-with-its-license" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Unable-to-activate-Windows-Store-app-Issue-with-its-license.jpg" width="494" height="230" /></a></p>
<p>I think it may be something to do with the way I regularly suspend and resume (instead of shutting down) my VM in between work stints causing some problems with the built-in development licensing that Microsoft now uses.</p>
<p>I've read online that some people have had success just performing a "Clean" and then "Build" in VS2012, but that doesn't seem to work for me, instead I have to close the solution and delete my project's <strong>bin </strong>and <strong>obj </strong>folders.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
