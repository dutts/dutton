<p>Today I took and passed the Microsoft 70-483: Programming in C# exam making me officially a "Programming in C# Specialist" (wooooo!)</p>
<p>This is part of a new set of exams working towards the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mcsd-windows-store-apps-certification.aspx" target="_blank">MCSD: Windows Store Apps Solution Developer certification</a> which is all about producing apps to target the new Windows 8 app store in either HTML5 or C# and seems to be replacing the old MCPD.</p>
<p>I already passed the JavaScript equivalent course earlier in the year and now hope to move on with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-484">70-484</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-485">70-485</a> to obtain <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mcsd-windows-store-apps-certification.aspx">MCSD: Windows Store Apps Using C#</a>.</p>
