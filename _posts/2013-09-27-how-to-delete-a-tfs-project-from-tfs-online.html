<p>Microsoft have pulled an absolute blinder giving us <a href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com/en-us/tfs-welcome.aspx">Team Foundation Service</a>, their TFS in the Cloud solution, but once you've fired off a few test projects to play with it and want to get on with some proper codeage, how do you delete them?</p>
<p>There's currently no way of doing that through their web interface, so you have to rely on the command prompt and either at least Visual Studio 2012 or the free <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30656">Team Explorer 2012</a> to give you the tfsdeleteproject.exe command.</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire up a command prompt (Start -&gt; Run "<em>cmd.exe</em>")</li>
<li>Navigate to where you've installed one of the above tools (<em>cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE"</em>)</li>
<li>Run <em>tfsdeleteproject.exe /force /collection:https://&lt;your tfs online collection name&gt;.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection "your project name"</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The key thing to remember here is the "/DefaultCollection". Even with the /force argument you'll be prompted before deleting.</p>
