<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>
<p>To celebrate 2010 in style, I'm launching a 365 Photography Project.</p>
<p>It's got it's own blog and I'll be posting photos to my <a href="http://flickr.com/dutts303" target="_blank">flickr</a> stream and to the blog every day so please check it out!</p>
<p>First post.... tomorrow! =) Hang-over or no hang-over.....</p>
<p>Right, let the festivities commence!</p>
