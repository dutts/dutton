<p>It's a bit of a long running joke that I'm not really a database guy, but let's just say that lately I've been exposed to a little more DB than usual and it's been quite a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>Anyway, this little feature in MySQL has proved pretty useful to me so I thought I'd make a note of it on my in-lieu-of-a-functioning-memory blog.</p>
<p>As the title says, what if you want to  combine the <strong>C</strong>reate and <strong>U</strong>pdate from your <strong>CRUD</strong> code in one query; say you're performing an <em>INSERT</em> with a nested <em>SELECT</em> to insert more than one row, but there's a chance that one of these inserts breaks a unique key constraint somewhere and so you want to <em>UPDATE</em> in that case instead?</p>
<p>This is where <em><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/insert-on-duplicate.html" target="_blank">INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE</a></em> comes to the rescue.</p>
