<p>Further to <a href="http://dutton.me.uk/index.php/2013/02/13/microsoft-70-483-programming-in-c-exam-passed" target="_blank">my studies</a> towards the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mcsd-windows-store-apps-certification.aspx" target="_blank">MCSD: Windows Store Apps Solution Developer certification</a>, today I took and passed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-484" target="_blank">Microsoft 70-484: Essentials of Developing Windows Store Apps using C#</a> exam.</p>
<p>I found this exam quite difficult, and to be honest only just scraped a pass this time. Although my work is predominantly WPF with more recent WinRT and Windows Phone 8, my Windows Store experience has been limited to home projects so that's probably why this was a challenge.</p>
<p>I used the excellent <a href="https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/essentials-of-developing-windows-store-apps-using-c-jump-start" target="_blank">Jump Start</a> video tutorials on the Microsoft Virtual Academy along with some further reading around the course content, but in hindsight I wish I had focused more on the specifics of Store App development, in particular the Windows 8 Built-In Controls and App Store layouts rather than just plain WPF.</p>
<p>Either way, a pass is a pass... Just <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-485" target="_blank">one more to go</a> before MCSD.</p>
