<p>I know I've been pretty quiet as far as technical blog posts are concerned but I've not abandoned this blog, I've been working over the last few months entirely on Windows network driver development (NDIS 5.1), something which I profess to having absolutely no prior experience with so there really wasn't anything relevant to blog about.</p>
<p>I've been making notes throughout the whole experience and so plan to post them shortly with the aim of helping anyone else who finds themselves in a similar situation and needs to get up to speed with Windows network driver development (NDIS 5.1). I am by no means an expert but want to share what I've learnt so far.</p>
