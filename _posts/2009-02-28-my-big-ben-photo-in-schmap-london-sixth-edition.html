I've just been sent an email by the guys at <a href="http://www.schmap.com/" target="_blank">Schmap</a> to let me know that my Big Ben photo on Flickr has been selected for inclusion in the newly released sixth edition of their Schmap London Guide. You can find the page with my photo on <a href="http://www.schmap.com/london/activities_westminster/p=587/i=587_73.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Schmap produce free travel guides for destinations all over the globe containing maps, useful links, guided tours and reviews for shops, hotels, restaurants, bars, sights and attractions.</p>
<p>They are available both online through their website, with <a href="http://www.schmap.com/?m=iphone#uid=london&amp;sid=activities_westminster&amp;p=587&amp;i=587_73" target="_blank">specially optimised versions</a> for mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPod Touch and mobile phones or through their Schmap application which comes in both Windows and Mac flavours.</p>
<p>I'm chuffed to have had one of my photos selected for their London guide, there's a hell of a lot of London photos on Flickr!</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>
