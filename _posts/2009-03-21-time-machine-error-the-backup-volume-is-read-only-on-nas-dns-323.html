<p>I wrote a while back <a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/2009/02/03/using-timemachine-with-a-normal-network-share/" target="_blank">here</a> about how I'd set up my D-Link DNS-323 NAS to allow Time Machine backups from my two macs. All has been going well up to a few days ago when I was greeted with this dialog on my MacBook after an automated backup attempt:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-174" title="Time Machine Error" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-1-300x140.png" alt="Time Machine Error" width="300" height="140" /></p>
<p>Nothing has changed on my DNS-323 config-wise and my Mac Mini's Time Machine still works fine, using exactly the same network share as my MacBook and the same username and password so I'm more than a little confused by this!</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds of google search results pointing to <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=387726" target="_blank">forum posts</a> discussing this but they all seem to suggest the same thing; after trying the obvious (Use Disk Utility to repair the drive, done... Power off the drive and mac and restart them both, done....) just reformat your drive. I really don't want to do this so I'm going to keep trying. Will report back my findings, but has anyone out there resolved this issue without a reformat?</p>
<p>Maybe this is the reason Apple turned off support for 'unsupported' network volumes afterall? I really hope not.</p>
