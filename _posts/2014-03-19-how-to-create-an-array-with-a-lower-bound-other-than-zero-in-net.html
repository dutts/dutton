<p>Did you know that you can create an Array with a lower bound other than zero in .Net?</p>
<p>A good friend of mine (cheers Jarek) showed me this a while back. I'm still yet to find a real-world application but it's interesting all the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Array.aspx" target="_blank">Array</a> has a method called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.createinstance.aspx" target="_blank">CreateInstance</a>, which is useful if you want to create an Array during run-time of a Type which might not be known beforehand. This will create an array of integers with length 5:</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
var array = Array.CreateInstance(typeof(int), 5);
</pre>
<p>One overload also lets you specify the lower bounds of the array. It is used to create multi-dimensional arrays, so you pass in arrays of lengths and bounds. This will create an array of integers, with length 50, indexed from 10.</p>
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
var array = Array.CreateInstance(typeof(int), new int[] {50}, new int[] {10});
</pre>
<p>I suppose this may come in useful when trying to model an existing offset numbering scheme in your domain, but has anyone come across this or used it before?</p>
