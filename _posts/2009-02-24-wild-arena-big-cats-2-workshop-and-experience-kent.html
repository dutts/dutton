<p>I've just myself booked onto Wild Arena's Big Cats 2 Workshop and Experience day in September. Although the actual venue visited seems to be kept a bit of an online secret, I have a rough idea (not too many 'big cat' collections in Kent) and will get the exact location details in the post.</p>
<p>I've heard great things about these big cat experience days. You get to go right up to the enclosures (which you can't generally do in zoos) and so take 'bar-free' photographs.</p>
<p>It's a while off yet but that was the soonest date with spaces, so fingers crossed the weather is good and I'll make sure I post my results!</p>
