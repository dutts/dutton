<p>If you have more than a handful of photos you want to delete on an iPhone or iPad it can be a bit of a pain to do manually and I often find on my 4S that if you have too many photos, deleting the entire Camera Roll through Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Usage just doesn't work. Here's how to do it with a Mac.</p>
<p><strong>NB: This will permanently delete photos from your phone, make sure you've backed up or sync'd anything you want to keep before doing this</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Connect your phone via USB to your Mac.</span></li>
<li>Open the <em>Preview</em> application, the easiest way is to search for it using <em>Spotlight</em> (the magnifying glass top right).<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-2292 aligncenter" title="Spotlight search for Preview" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-29-at-08.56.32.png" width="438" height="126" /></li>
<li>Once open, from the <em>File</em> menu you should see your iOS device listed, mine's called "Richard's iPhone". Select <em>Import from</em>....<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-2302 aligncenter" title="Import from phone" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-29-at-08.57.13.png" width="318" height="382" /></li>
<li>You'll then see thumbnails of all of the photos on your device. I clearly like coffee =).<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-2312 aligncenter" title="View photos on device" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-29-at-08.57.47.png" width="803" height="626" /></li>
<li>Now select the photos you want to delete, either individually (holding down CMD to multi-select) or CMD-A to select all.<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-2322 aligncenter" title="Select all photos" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-29-at-08.58.16.png" width="804" height="626" /></li>
<li>And hit the delete button at the bottom.<img class="size-full wp-image-2332 aligncenter" title="Delete button indicated" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-07-29-at-08.58.161.png" width="804" height="626" /></li>
<li>That's it.... it's as simple as that, you're photos will be deleted.</li>
</ol>
