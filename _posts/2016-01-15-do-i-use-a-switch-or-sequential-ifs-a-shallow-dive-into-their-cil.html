<p>I recently found myself needing to convert a calculation on ints to use double values. One of the functions within this calculation was a switch statement and as switch only supports <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exx3b86w.aspx" target="_blank">integral </a>types, this needed more than just a type change.</p>
<p>I was fortunate in that this particular double value was always at most one decimal place which left me with two possible options; either replace the switch with a bunch of sequential if statements or multiply the double by 10, cast it to an int and switch on the resulting int.</p>
<p>Ignoring the debate over whether the cast is a bit too hacky, it got me thinking; what is the difference in compiled output (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language" target="_blank">CIL</a>) between switch and sequential ifs covering the same test cases? Given that the cases of a switch are compile time constants and together as a block, does the compiler make any attempt to optimise the comparison or does it just grind through all the cases linearly until a match is found (making it essentially syntactic sugar for sequential ifs).</p>
<p>Out came a test project and <a href="http://ilspy.net/" target="_blank">ILSpy </a>and this is what I found.</p>
<p>Here's the test code and corresponding annotated CIL (Release build, .Net 4.5):</p>
<pre class="c-sharp" name="code">public static int SwitchTest(int x) 
{ 
    switch (x) 
    { 
        case 10: return 1; 
        case 20: return 2; 
        case 30: return 3; 
    }
    return -1; 
}

public static int IfTest(int x)
{
    if (x == 10) return 1;
    if (x == 20) return 2;
    if (x == 30) return 3;
    return -1;
}
</pre>

<p>Although only a single example for my very simple use case, the only significant difference between the two compiled outputs is that the switch example uses <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.beq_s.aspx" target="_blank">beq.s</a> positive comparison (equals) and the if example uses <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.bne_un_s.aspx" target="_blank">bne.un.s</a> negative comparison (not equals) to achieve the same result. Because of this, in the scenario where no match is made the switch example involves executing one more instruction.</p>
<p>Will the extra instruction be make or break for the performance of your application? Certainly not, but contrary to the spirit of endless abstraction I find it grounding to occasionally head in the opposite direction and see what even the most basic of language constructs represent under the hood.</p>
<p>As far as I can see in this case the only real argument is that of code legibility. Now I know...</p>
