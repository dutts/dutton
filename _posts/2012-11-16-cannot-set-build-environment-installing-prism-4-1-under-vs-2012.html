<p>I can't believe it's been over a year since I last posted, I guess that's F1 for you =)</p>
<p>Anyway, I've had some time this morning to work on personal projects at home and came across a problem trying to install PRISM 4.1 on Visual Studio 2012.</p>
<p>When I try to register the PRISM binaries on my system (RegisterPrismBinaries.bat), I get the following error</p>
<blockquote><p>PRISM 'VS100COMNTOOLS' not set. Cannot set the build environment</p></blockquote>
<p>Visual Studio 2012 doesn't register this path.</p>
<p>To fix this, add the following to the start of RegisterPrismBinaries.bat:</p>
<blockquote><p>SET VS100COMNTOOLS=C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0Common7Tools</p></blockquote>
<p>Or wherever your vsvars32.bat from Visual Studio 2012 lives.</p>
