<p>I know that this is a bit off piste from my usual subject matter but software engineers and coffee are pretty much inseparable and I'm no exception.</p>
<p>My coffee machine recently started playing up. Turn it on, see the light come on to show its ready, load her up and press the button to expect a delivery of the black gold liquid I've become dependent on, but no... Lots of "coffee machine" noise, but no coffee.</p>
<p>Turns out I've been leaving it switched on for too long and this particular model has an overheating cut out which according to the manual requires a service engineer back at Gaggia to reset.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a bit of googling led me to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/RVMZN97LYETDS" target="_blank">this</a> Amazon review which explains what to do and so I've reproduced it here with photos for anyone else who may encounter the same issue.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">NB: This is for information only, opening the machine will certainly invalidate your warranty and may expose you to high temperatures and live electrical circuits. I hold no responsibility for any damages or loss encountered by following these instructions.</span><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unplug the machine from the mains.</li>
<li>Slide the water tank out.</li>
<li>Locate and remove the two screws holding to the top plate (indicated below).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Remove the top plate (be careful not to damage the rubber seal).</li>
<li>Locate the overheat trip switch (indicated on the photos below).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Push this down with a screwdriver.</span></li>
<li>Reassemble and test.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with the comments on this review; this switch shouldn't really require disassembly to access and from reading some of the other comments, quite a few people have returned "broken" units with this problem before discovering how to fix it.</p>
<p>Bit of a design flaw in otherwise an awesome espresso machine.</p>
<p>Anyway, caffeine source fixed, back to coding =)</p>
