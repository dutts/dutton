<p>Moving my blog's hosting onto Azure over the Bank Holiday weekend, if you're reading this then it's succeeded, if you spot anything strange then please let me know in a comment.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p><strong>Update 30/05/2013</strong></p>
<p>Azure move is complete, but the old hosting is still up. From my visitor stats data, it looks like the nameserver change is taking a while to propagate, so if you're not reading this, it hasn't reached you yet, but then I guess you wouldn't know... so....</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll crack on with posting new content here, and I'm sure you'll all catch up soon.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2 30/05/2013</strong></p>
<p>I have figured out why my visitor stats are so low; the old permalinks which took you straight to specific posts had been broken so the google search results and any links posted to forums were returning a 404. A side effect of moving from a linux to a windows based host is that IIS was putting index.php into the url that it was expecting. Thanks to Webloggerz for their <a href="http://webloggerz.com/how-to-remove-index-php-from-wordpress-url" target="_blank">excellent tutorial</a> on how to fix this.</p>
