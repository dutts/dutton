<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-4932 alignleft" alt="Lego Life of George Screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lifeofgeorge-300x200.png" width="300" height="200" />For those of you who know me it's no surprise that I'm a big kid with a borderline unhealthy fascination with Lego, so when Mrs Santa very kindly brought me the Lego <a href="http://george.lego.com/en-gb/" target="_blank">Life of George</a> game this year you can understand my disappointment to download the iOS app on my iPhone only to find it consistently crash on startup rendering the whole thing pretty useless.</p>
<p>Same story on my iPad and no matter how many times I restarted or closed all other apps. It's understandably getting quite a lot of bad reviews on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-life-of-george/id463288121?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> with people threatening to return it.</p>
<p>Anyway, until Lego sort this out you can get the app working (albeit with all the online functionality disabled) if you put your device in <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1355" target="_blank">airline mode</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps any other kids out there (both big and small :) ).</p>
