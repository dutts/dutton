<p>I'm a software engineer with 14 years experience of development in C, C++, Python, C# and more recently F#.</p>
<p>Currently working in London for a software consultancy, my career so far has involved me being responsible for software in defence, industrial control, and motorsport.</p>
<p>My previous role was Software Technical Team Lead at the multiple world championship winning Formula 1 team, Red Bull Racing.</p>
<p>Prior to this I haveÂ worked commercially with C and C++ since 2002, mainly in the network and telecommunications fields while working for <a href="http://www.hmgcc.gov.uk/default.aspx" target="_blank">Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre</a>, HMGCC.</p>
<p>Other projects have involved me with project management, database design, driver development and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, PHP and Python.</p>
<p>I'm a keen photographer and love traveling the world and seeing new people and places.</p>
<p>I use this blog to post things that I find useful on my travels. All code snippets and advice is provided as-is with no implied warranty and does not represent the views of my current or previous employers.</p>
