I’m a software engineer with 14 years experience of development in C, C++, Python, C# and more recently F#.

Currently working in London for a software consultancy, my career so far has involved me being responsible for software in defence, industrial control, and motorsport.

My previous role was Software Technical Team Lead at the multiple world championship winning Formula 1 team, Red Bull Racing.

Prior to this I have worked commercially with C and C++ since 2002, mainly in the network and telecommunications fields while working for Her Majesty’s Government Communications Centre, HMGCC.

Other projects have involved me with project management, database design, driver development and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, PHP and Python.

I’m a keen photographer and love traveling the world and seeing new people and places.

I use this blog to post things that I find useful on my travels. All code snippets and advice is provided as-is with no implied warranty and does not represent the views of my current or previous employers.
