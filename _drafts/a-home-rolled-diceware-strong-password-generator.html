<p>A lot of us are terrible at coming up with passwords to protect our data if a few recent security publications are anything to go by; security consultancy Trustwave reported at the beginning of this year that out of the 574 data compromises they investigated in 2015, 28% of them resulted from weak passwords and Splashdata, now in their fifth year of publishing the results of analysis from leaked password dumps, released their <a href="https://www.teamsid.com/worst-passwords-2015/" target="_blank">2015 worst passwords list</a> ('<em>123456'</em>, '<em>password'</em>, and '<em>1234567' </em>still occupying the top three positions from 2014).</p>
<p>The importance of creating a 'strong' password by increasing the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Entropy_as_a_measure_of_password_strength">bits of entropy</a> has gone mainstream over the last few years; Randall Munroe's excellent <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd</a>, and even <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/35351265/star-wars-is-now-one-of-the-most-popular-passwords" target="_blank">BBC Newsbeat</a> have provided suggestions for strong password generation, yet I'm sure I'm not alone in too often going down the 'safe' route of substituting in a few capital letters, numbers for vowels and the odd punctuation mark to a word and feeling I've done my bit to keep safe.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/" target="_blank">this article</a> early last year I decided to beef up my own password generation method and have a go at <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html" target="_blank">Diceware</a>. The idea is to use the result of multiple dice rolls to provide a lookup into a numbered word list for the words that make up your password. The original word list <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc" target="_blank">suggested</a> by Diceware's creator, Arnold Reinhold, was 7776 short American English words, abbreviations and easy to remember character strings. There appears to be a sad absence of dice in the Dutton household so I had a go at writing something. I know, it defeats the real world randomness of things, but after some <a href="https://github.com/dutts/DicewareNet/issues/1" target="_blank">feedback</a> on GitHub I've swapped out the CLR Random for the one used in the .NET cryptographic libraries, and as the article says a computer generated random is "good enough". At Reinhold's recommendation, as I am using a computer generated dice roll, DicewareNet uses the extended "8k" word list <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware8k.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Reinhold has <a href="http://diceware.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/time-to-add-word.html" target="_blank">since suggested</a> using six words rather than the original five due to the increasing processing power available for password cracking. DicewareNet produces seven words out of the box but it's configurable in code.</p>
<p>DicewareNet takes the form of a command line text and GUI version with a thumbnail look-up from Flickr using <a href="https://github.com/samjudson/flickr-net" target="_blank">flickr-net</a>, a C# wrapper for their API. Some words don't lend themselves to an image search and Flickr just sometimes plainly gets it wrong but I find it more useful than not.</p>
<p>You can find the compiled application here, and the source in <a href="https://github.com/dutts/DicewareNet" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, hope you find it as useful as I do, feel free to send me a pull request.</p>
