<p>Ever since google moved their cloud based productivity suite "Google Apps" away from the "we'll make money from your data" to the "we'll make money from your money" model they also <a href="http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en-uk&amp;hlrm=en-uk&amp;hlrm=en&amp;answer=2855120">stopped new sign-ups</a> for their free "Standard Edition" for individuals.</p>
<p>For those late to the party, Google Apps provides most of the standard gmail suite (mail, calendar, contacts, docs (or drive as it's now called), google+, etc) but for your own domain, with the addition of some user and domain management thrown in. I have been happily using Google Apps for dutton.me.uk and a few of my other domains for years and fortunately this change doesn't affect existing users.</p>
<p>But there's still a way to get a Google Apps account, albeit for a single user, through a method they've left open for their App Engine developers.</p>
<p>Here's how:<!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://appengine.google.com">http://appengine.google.com</a> and log in with your personal google account (this doesn't need to be anything to do with the domain you want to use, any google account will do).<br />
<a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1.png"><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-531 alignleft" title="Welcome to Google App Engine" alt="Welcome to Google App Engine" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1.png" width="550" height="171" /></a></li>
<li>Verify your account with a phone number.<br />
<a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-532" alt="Verify your account" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2.png" width="572" height="486" /></a></li>
<li>Once you have verified, you will be taken to a form to create an application, just use any available name you want for <em>Application Identifier</em> and <em>Application Title</em>, they won't be used again, leave all the other settings on this page as default values.<br />
<a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-533" alt="Create an Application" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3.png" width="585" height="489" /></a></li>
<li>Once your application is registered, you will be taken to a confirmation page. Click the link to go to your <em>Dashboard</em>.</li>
<li>At the <em>Dashboard, </em>click <em>Application Settings </em>on the left hand side menu and scroll down to find the <em>Domain Setup</em> section, click <em>Add Domain</em>.</li>
<li>At the next page, ignore the left hand side, click on the "<em>Sign up for Google Apps Standard"</em> link in the text on the right.<br />
<a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-534" alt="Add Domain" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4.png" width="808" height="243" /></a></li>
<li>You'll now be able to sign up for a free Google Apps account, fill out all the information you need to here and away you go!<br />
<a href="http://www.dutton.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/5.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-535" alt="Get started with Google Apps for free" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5.png" width="948" height="439" /></a></li>
</ol>
<p>This Apps account is limited to one user, if you need more you can sign up for a free (no credit card required) trial of their full Apps for Business solution. I have read that if you do that, create more users, then cancel your free trial you will keep these users without having to pay but YMMV.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is for information only, it's a loophole taking advantage of the fact that to develop for the Google App Engine you need a Google Apps account so may change in the future.</p>
