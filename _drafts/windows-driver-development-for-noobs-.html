<p>My latest project has me doing some Windows driver development, NDIS Intermediate network drivers to be more precise and so I thought I'd post some of the gotchas and tribal knowledge I have come across over the past few weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The development kit containing the compiler, libraries and sample code and documentation (previously known as the DDK), is now known as the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). The latest version of which can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/wdk/default.mspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
