<p>It's probably not very surprising that my blog post that gets the most number of hits at the weekend is this, I picture a load of frustrated software engineers blankly staring at the "ready" red light on their Gaggias ready to throw it out of the window when it just sits and makes noise rather than delivering another shot of espresso goodness.</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress, I've been trialling some mail order coffee clubs lately so thought I'd post up some notes on an old hand in the business, Kopi, versus a relative newcomer, YourGrind.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price</strong><br />
Kopi's "Coffee Explorer Club" costs £8.95 per month for 250g of beans or ground, and you can cancel any time, or £8.45 for a three monthly subscription. </p>
<p>YourGrind is £6.95, again for 250g of beans or ground, you can also cancel any time</p>
<p>Winner : YourGrind</p>
<p><strong>Website</strong></p>
<p><strong>Service</strong></p>
